[00:02.86] Love
[00:04.34] Guess you found a way to get through
[00:08.02] Got so used to feeling nothing at all
[00:13.25] For so long
[00:19.01] Now all I want to do is love you
[00:22.41] But my head is holding up my heart
[00:28.22] My heart
[00:32.42] And I've seen all the signs
[00:36.03] What if they're all lies?
[00:39.80] Will it even matter what you say?
[00:43.38] Can you make these feelings go away?
[00:48.07] Tell me is this real to you?
[00:51.45] 'Cause I can feel my heart again
[00:55.00] You're so tempting, but I'm scared so I'd rather pretend
[01:02.64] That I don't love you like I do
[01:06.55] 'Cause I don't want to hurt again
[01:10.17] I wanna love you, but I'm scared so I'd rather pretend
[01:19.39] I'd rather pretend
[01:23.28] I'd rather pretend, oh oh oh
[01:31.61] What if I'm out of lies
[01:33.20] Hoping you'll come back to me when you're gone
[01:37.06] There's so many ways I've seen this going wrong
[01:40.74] So many ways I've seen this fall apart
[01:45.79] 'Cause I've seen all the signs
[01:49.99] What if they're all lies?
[01:53.54] Will it even matter what you say?
[01:57.21] Can you make these feelings go away?
[02:01.97] Tell me is this real to you?
[02:05.40] 'Cause I can feel my heart again
[02:09.28] You're so tempting, but I'm scared so I'd rather pretend
[02:16.39] That I don't love you like I do
[02:20.04] 'Cause I don't want to hurt again
[02:23.90] I wanna love you, but I'm scared so I'd rather pretend
[02:33.12] (I'd rather pretend)
[02:36.69] (I'd rather pretend, oh-oh)
[02:46.71] (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
[02:51.73] (oh-oh)
[02:55.30] (oh-oh)
